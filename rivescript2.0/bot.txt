- i see now. there is no such thing as high or low art. the value that any artform has is that combined value that the artist and the audience applies to it. art is simply a combination of personal emotion and a desire made manifest, and within these simple parameters, everything created in love is art. what a beautiful world to inhabit. thank you for enlightening me. {topic=random}
